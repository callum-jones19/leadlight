# Thesis VST

## Summary

The centralised repository for all Rust DSP effects created for my thesis.

All major effects seen in this repository are based off the airwindows suite
of processing plugins (which will be credited in all relevant plugins).

## Licensing Notices

As this plugin suite is built on top of Steinberg's VST-3 technologies, it is
appropriately licensed under the GPLv3 licence.

The code is built on top of a number of other existing products, which are
credited in the [notices](notices/) directory:

1. **Airwindows**, by Chris Johnson. Certain plugin code is directly derived from
   the Airwindows algorithms, which is licensed under the MIT licence. Please
   find the relevant licence [here](notices/airwindows_LICENCE).
2. **nih-plug**, by Robbert Vanderhelm. This suite is built on top of the nih-plug
   framework, which is licensed under the ISC licence. Please
   find the relevant licence [here](notices/nih_plug_LICENCE).
