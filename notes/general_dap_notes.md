# General DAP Notes

## Definitions

### Wet/dry

Sources:

- https://www.reddit.com/r/synthesizers/comments/s32do3/eli5_dry_vs_wet_effects/

Explanation

- Dry signal = unaffected input
- Wet signal is the affected output
- Taking reverb as an example:
  - 100% wet = completely unaffected sound - no reverb whatsoever, just the input sound unaffected.
  - 100% dry = only the reverb effect. You wouldn't hear **any** of the source audio, just the stuff
    that was coming out of the reverb algorithm.
  - For something like reverb, you would probably want a mix of wet/dry signals, not just the one.

### ZPlane Filters

TODO

### Lowpass/Highpass Filters

Lowpass filter = a filter that *passes* signals with a frequency lower than a selected
cutoff frequency, and *attenuates* signals with frequencies higher than the cutoff
frequency.

Highpass filter = *passes* signals with frequency higher than the cutoff frequency, and
*attenuates* signals with frequencies lower than the cutoff frequency.

### Headroom

### Noise floor
