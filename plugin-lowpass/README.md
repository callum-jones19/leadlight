# Lowpass

A basic lowpass filter. The algorithm was derived by stripping the
Airwindows Lowpass filter down to its bare essentials.

The design process was a combination of the knowledge I learned
from both [the DSTBook](/notes/dstbook_notes.md) and [The Scientist and
Engineer's Guide to DSP](/notes/scientist_engineer_guide_to_dsp.md). The
source for each set of notes is referenced in the linked markdown file.
